# backbone-es6-localstorage-todos-requirejs-es5
Provides the canonical TODOS web app using RequireJS and the AMD ES5 bundle generated by [backbone-es6](https://github.com/typhonjs/backbone-es6).

This is a rhetorical demo showing how to consume the library in a RequireJS context. This is absolutely NOT the recommended way to consume `backbone-es6`, but gives an example for those converting from RequireJS usage to JSPM / SystemJS. Please see [backbone-es6-localstorage-todos](https://github.com/typhonjs-demos/backbone-es6-localstorage-todos) for the recommended way to work with backbone-es6 and JSPM / SystemJS.

More info coming soon.
